          If the institution does not use WebCT's "Learning Modules" (including schools who adopted WebCT
            prior to version 4.0, when modules were made available), course migrations can be improved by importing the "Course Content"
            as HotChalk Ember Modules instead of the "Learning Modules". This page allows one to set the default behavior of the WebCT migrator
            with respect to content modules. It is important to remember that, while individual course migrations retain the ability
            to choose, the bulk migrator always utilizes the value configured here and cannot be changed per migration.
