Congratulations on your acceptance to Concordia University-Portland. Whether, taught online or on-ground, all courses rely upon the Canvas Learning Management System (LMS) to provide students and instructors with an enhanced communication platform (i.e., access to course materials, assignments, the gradebook, integrated e-mail, discussion board, important course-related links, etc.).

Hence, as a newly enrolled user at Concordia University-Portland, you have been provided with an account to access the Canvas LMS platform. Before your courses begin we encourage you to log on and get acquainted with the platform.

To access Canvas:

   • Login to http://login.cu-portland.edu/canvas with your my.CU username and password. Please bookmark this page, if you have not done so already, as it is the only access point for your Canvas courses.

   • To view your courses, hover over the Courses tab at the top of the page. You will see all courses you are enrolled in that have been published.

   • If you are unable to access Canvas or your course, please submit a help ticket at http://support.hotchalklearn.com/support.html and our support team will get back to you promptly.

Warm regards,
Canvas Support
