<p>Congratulations on your acceptance to Concordia University-Portland. Whether, taught online or on-ground, all courses rely upon the Canvas Learning Management System (LMS) to provide students and instructors with an enhanced communication platform (i.e., access to course materials, assignments, the gradebook, integrated e-mail, discussion board, important course-related links, etc.).</p>

<p>Hence, as a newly enrolled user at Concordia University-Portland, you have been provided with an account to access the Canvas LMS platform. Before your courses begin we encourage you to log on and get acquainted with the platform.</p>

<p>To access Canvas:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Login to <a href="http://login.cu-portland.edu/canvas">http://login.cu-portland.edu/canvas</a> with your my.CU username and password. Please bookmark this page, if you have not done so already, as it is the only access point for your Canvas courses.</li>
    <li>To view your courses, hover over the Courses tab at the top of the page. You will see all courses you are enrolled in that have been published.</li>
    <li>If you are unable to access Canvas or your course, please submit a help ticket at <a href="http://support.hotchalklearn.com/support.html">http://support.hotchalklearn.com/support.html</a> and our support team will get back to you promptly.</li>
